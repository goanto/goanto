## 👋 About Me

I'm a Software Architect and Platform Engineer with **8+ years of experience** building production-grade AI/LLM infrastructure, cloud-native platforms, and distributed systems. I hold a **PhD in Distributed Systems** from Inria Labs (France) and have served as **Co-Founder & CTO** at Optimitz, where I architected multi-provider LLM routing platforms and cross-platform mobile applications.

My expertise lies at the intersection of **AI infrastructure, cloud platforms, and distributed systems**. I've built and scaled platforms serving **200,000+ daily users**, led engineering teams, and published research in top-tier conferences. I'm passionate about solving complex technical challenges and delivering high-impact solutions.

**Currently available for freelance consulting and architecture projects.**
